# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First JavaScript assignment

Rock Paper Scissors V1

This assignment was mainly to be viewed through 'console.log.'  It was to be five rounds against a random computer pick.  The player input was to be done through a 'prompt' popup, and I threw in an 'alert' popup at the end to state a final winner (it was supposed to be in 'console.log' as well).

-Make separate html / javaScript docs & link them
-List choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
-If / else if / else....to tell the computer who / what beats what (example...(player chose) Rock beats (computer chose) Scissors).

-get random computer choice
-get player choice through 'prompt'
-make player choice input match choices by capitalizing first letter and lower case the rest

-show results including score of each round in 'console.log'
-show outcome at the end

Very basic, but became problematic when introducing the 'Math.random' function because I placed it at the top of my JS with the other 'const's' instead of within the function. Once I figured that out it went pretty smooth.
